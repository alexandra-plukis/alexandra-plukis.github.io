# personal-website
## Welcome to my personal website, made for kicks and giggles and education
I made this website using HTML, CSS, and a tiny little bit of Javascript (resume animation).

### Why I made this website
I always wanted to experiment with design online. After figuring out the format and colors I liked, I decided to go ahead and build out a basic website to show some information about myself. I decided to make the website as simple as possible to use it for education as well. In my role as a Peer Mentor in my dorm at ASU, I hosted workshops for underclassmen. One of these workshops was based on git and website creation. Using basic elements of this website, like the header and floating content blocks, I was able to help some students get scaffolding in place for their own corner of the internet.

### Your website is so beautiful, can I use it?
Yes, please do! I loved seeing students make the columns, floating blocks, and timelines their own :)
